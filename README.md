## WHY SQUADS MODERATION BOT? üìå

> ‚ÅâÔ∏è Discord servers can be very difficult to moderate and keep track of why, when or who attended issues or conflicts.<br>Discord has no option to moderate everything from the same place, their audit logs can be very confusing on larger Discord servers.<br>

     <summary>üí° Solution</summary>
          SQUADS MODERATION BOT provides a panel where you can warn, timeout or ban users by mentioning them or by their ID.<br>![Screenshot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/901009468807065643/1062742628665413672/image.png)<br>The bot is programmed to display the rules of the server and by choosing a rule it will allow you to punish the user that broke that rule.
